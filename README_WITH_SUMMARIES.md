# Gemini Enterprise ADK Examples

This repository contains examples and utilities for the Gemini Enterprise ADK.

## Project Structure

*   `agent.py`: This file defines the `GitHubExpert` AI agent, outlining its role in documentation, its workflow for creating/updating READMEs, and its toolset for interacting with GitHub.
*   `test server.py`: This file initializes an MCP server and defines several tools for interacting with the GitHub API, including functions to read file content, get project dependencies, retrieve repository information, list repository contents, analyze and suggest READMEs, find README targets, create branches, commit files, and create pull requests.
*   `__init__.py`: This file serves as a standard Python package initialization file, importing the `root_agent` from `agent.py`.
*   `localtest.md`: This Markdown file provides an overview of the Gemini Enterprise ADK Examples repository, listing key files and outlining sections for getting started, usage, and contributing.
