## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key files and their purposes in this repository:

*   `.github/`: Contains GitHub-specific configurations, possibly for workflows or issue templates.
*   `__init__.py`: Standard Python package initialization file, marking the directory as a Python package.
*   `agent.py`: This file defines the `GitHubExpert` AI agent, outlining its role in creating high-quality READMEs, its workflow for analyzing repositories, creating branches, checking dependencies, generating content, and creating pull requests.
*   `localtest.md`: A markdown file, possibly for local testing documentation or notes.
*   `test server.py`: This file (which appears to be `mcp_server.py` based on its content) initializes an MCP server and defines several tools for interacting with the GitHub API, including functions to read file content, get project dependencies, retrieve repository information, list repository contents, analyze and suggest READMEs, find README targets, create branches, commit files, and create pull requests.
