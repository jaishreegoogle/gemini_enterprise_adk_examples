# Gemini Enterprise ADK Examples

This repository provides example implementations using the Gemini Enterprise Agent Development Kit (ADK). It showcases how to build and deploy AI agents that can interact with GitHub for various documentation and repository management tasks.

## Project Structure and Key Files

*   `agent.py`: This file defines the `GitHubExpert` AI agent, which specializes in GitHub documentation workflows, including discovering subfolders needing READMEs, analyzing existing READMEs, checking dependencies, and automating Pull Requests for README creation/updates.
*   `test server.py` (mcp_server.py): This file initializes an MCP (Multi-Channel Protocol) server and defines several tools for interacting with the GitHub API, such as reading file content, getting project dependencies, retrieving repository information, listing repository contents, analyzing and suggesting READMEs, finding README targets, creating branches, committing files, and creating pull requests.
